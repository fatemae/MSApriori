# MSApriori
MS - Apriori is an algorithm to find frequent itemsets from data with multiple minimum support. With the regular Apriori algorithm, frequent itemsets found has only one support regardless of the frequency of the itemsets. This creates two problems

-If the minimum support is very high, we miss all the rare itemsets and end up with frequent itemsets which are very obvious.

-If the minimum support is very low, we have a problem of combinatorial explosion whierein we have very vast amount of itemsets which might not be practically useful.
